Installation
**************************

For now, just use pip to get featuremonkey directly from github::

    pip install git+https://github.com/henzk/featuremonkey.git#egg=featuremonkey

That should be it. You can check by importing ``featuremonkey`` from a python prompt.
If you don't see an error, everything should be ok.
